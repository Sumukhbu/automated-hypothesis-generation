    "abstract": "This article reviews the \"Once learning\" mechanism that was proposed 23 years ago and the subsequent successes of \"One-shot learning\" in image classification and \"You Only Look Once - YOLO\" in objective detection. Analyzing the current development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the proposal is that AI should be clearly divided into the following categories: Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI), Artificial Machine Intelligence (AMI), and Artificial Biological Intelligence (ABI), which will also be the main directions of theory and application development for AI. As a watershed for the branches of AI, some classification standards and methods are discussed: 1) Human-oriented, machine-oriented, and biological-oriented AI R&D; 2) Information input processed by Dimensionality-up or Dimensionality-reduction; 3) The use of one/few or large samples for knowledge learning.",

    "abstract": "Who should be charged with responsibility for an artificial intelligence performing market manipulation have been discussed. In this study, I constructed an artificial intelligence using a genetic algorithm that learns in an artificial market simulation, and investigated whether the artificial intelligence discovers market manipulation through learning with an artificial market simulation despite a builder of artificial intelligence has no intention of market manipulation. As a result, the artificial intelligence discovered market manipulation as an optimal investment strategy. This result suggests necessity of regulation, such as obligating builders of artificial intelligence to prevent artificial intelligence from performing market manipulation.",
