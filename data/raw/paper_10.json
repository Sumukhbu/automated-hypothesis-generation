  "title": "Watershed of Artificial Intelligence: Human Intelligence, Machine   Intelligence, and Biological Intelligence",
  "abstract": "This article reviews the \"Once learning\" mechanism that was proposed 23 years ago and the subsequent successes of \"One-shot learning\" in image classification and \"You Only Look Once - YOLO\" in objective detection. Analyzing the current development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the proposal is that AI should be clearly divided into the following categories: Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI), Artificial Machine Intelligence (AMI), and Artificial Biological Intelligence (ABI), which will also be the main directions of theory and application development for AI. As a watershed for the branches of AI, some classification standards and methods are discussed: 1) Human-oriented, machine-oriented, and biological-oriented AI R&D; 2) Information input processed by Dimensionality-up or Dimensionality-reduction; 3) The use of one/few or large samples for knowledge learning.",
