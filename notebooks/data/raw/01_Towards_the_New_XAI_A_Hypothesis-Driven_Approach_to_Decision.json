  "title": "Towards the New XAI: A Hypothesis-Driven Approach to Decision Support\n  Using Evidence",
  "abstract": "Prior research on AI-assisted human decision-making has explored several\ndifferent explainable AI (XAI) approaches. A recent paper has proposed a\nparadigm shift calling for hypothesis-driven XAI through a conceptual framework\ncalled evaluative AI that gives people evidence that supports or refutes\nhypotheses without necessarily giving a decision-aid recommendation. In this\npaper, we describe and evaluate an approach for hypothesis-driven XAI based on\nthe Weight of Evidence (WoE) framework, which generates both positive and\nnegative evidence for a given hypothesis. Through human behavioural\nexperiments, we show that our hypothesis-driven approach increases decision\naccuracy and reduces reliance compared to a recommendation-driven approach and\nan AI-explanation-only baseline, but with a small increase in under-reliance\ncompared to the recommendation-driven approach. Further, we show that\nparticipants used our hypothesis-driven approach in a materially different way\nto the two baselines."
