  "title": "HypoBench: Towards Systematic and Principled Benchmarking for Hypothesis\n  Generation",
  "abstract": "There is growing interest in hypothesis generation with large language models\n(LLMs). However, fundamental questions remain: what makes a good hypothesis,\nand how can we systematically evaluate methods for hypothesis generation? To\naddress this, we introduce HypoBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate\nLLMs and hypothesis generation methods across multiple aspects, including\npractical utility, generalizability, and hypothesis discovery rate. HypoBench\nincludes 7 real-world tasks and 5 synthetic tasks with 194 distinct datasets.\nWe evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs combined with six existing\nhypothesis-generation methods. Overall, our results suggest that existing\nmethods are capable of discovering valid and novel patterns in the data.\nHowever, the results from synthetic datasets indicate that there is still\nsignificant room for improvement, as current hypothesis generation methods do\nnot fully uncover all relevant or meaningful patterns. Specifically, in\nsynthetic settings, as task difficulty increases, performance significantly\ndrops, with best models and methods only recovering 38.8% of the ground-truth\nhypotheses. These findings highlight challenges in hypothesis generation and\ndemonstrate that HypoBench serves as a valuable resource for improving AI\nsystems designed to assist scientific discovery."
